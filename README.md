This is a mod for [Foundation](https://foundation-game.fandom.com/wiki/Foundation_Wiki) that collects a number of tweaks that I have made.

## project goals

1. Learn how to write mods for Foundation.
2. Build a collection of production tweaks to boost my city's efficiency so that I can build tighter cities.

## resources

[The Foundation Modding Documentation](https://www.polymorph.games/foundation/modding/)
[Foundation Mod Library](https://mod.io/g/foundation)

I've drawn heavily from the following:

- [BetterFarms](https://mod.io/g/foundation/m/webetterfarms#description)
- [LivestockPlus](https://mod.io/g/foundation/m/livestockplus#discussion)

Thank you to these authors who's work has inspired me to try this and informed me to create my first mod.
