This is a mod for [Foundation](https://foundation-game.fandom.com/wiki/Foundation_Wiki) that collects a number of tweaks that I have made.

## project goals

1. Learn how to write mods for Foundation.
2. Build a collection of production tweaks to boost my city's efficiency so that I can build tighter cities.
